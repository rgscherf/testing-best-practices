# New Testing Framework

## Introduction

Good tests help developers move faster and with more confidence. They prove that our code works correctly under a variety of conditions, demonstrate that requirements have been met, and help identify errors and regressions in other parts of the code base.

We are always striving to improve code quality. Until now, however, we have been less attentive to the quality of our *test code*. By committing to improve every test class in our organization, we are recognizing test code as a first-class member of our code base. This recognition means transitioning to a higher standard of quality, using a framework described in this documentation.

## How to use this document

The first two chapters give an overview of the testing framework and a worked example. You should be able to jump into writing good tests after reading these sections.

The rest of the document is a reference covering each piece of the framework. Every reference page includes discussion about the objective, plus detailed requirements about how to meet it.
