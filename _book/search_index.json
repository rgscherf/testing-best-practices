Testing Framework\nIntroduction\nGood tests help developers move faster and with more confidence. They prove that our code works correctly under a variety of conditions, demonstrate that requirements have been met, and help identify errors and regressions in other parts of the code base.\nWe are always striving to improve code quality. Until now, however, we have been less attentive to the quality of our test code. By committing to improve every test class in our organization, we are recognizing test code as a first-class member of our code base. This recognition means transitioning to a higher standard of quality, using a framework described in this documentation.\nHow to use this document\nThe first two chapters give an overview of the testing framework and a worked example. You should be able to jump into writing good tests after reading these sections.\nThe rest of the document is a reference covering each piece of the framework. Every reference page includes discussion about the objective, plus detailed requirements about how to meet it.\n"},"overview/framework.html":{"url":"overview/framework.html","title":"Framework Overview","keywords":"","body":"Framework Overview\nBecause it is notoriously difficult to measure code quality using machine tools, we have decided to grade our new tests using a human assessor and a simple evaluation framework. \nThe each objective in the evaluation framework is a common-sense best practice for unit testing. Together, the objectives ensure that our tests will be meaningful, maintainable, and readable. \nHow the framework is organized\nThe framework is divided into nine objectives. Each objective is a possible attribute of your code, independent from the others.\nObjectives are grouped into three themes. Themes describe the conceptual stages of writing tests: initiate code -> run tests -> (re)format tests. \nWhen it comes to assessing your code, you must achieve all six of the objectives under the Initiate Tests and Run Tests themes. Achieving the remaining objectives, under the Format Tests theme, is optional but highly recommended.\nFramework definition\nAll testing objectives are booleans applied to your entire test class. The assessor will look at all of the test methods you've written, and decide whether each objective has been met by the test class as a whole. If that seems imprecise, it's because the system is designed to help us look at test quality across the entire code base.\nTesting objectives are described below. Much more detail about each objective can be found in subsequent chapters of this document.\n\n\n\nTheme\nObjective\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nInitiate Tests\nDocument Your Tests\nAre tests methods and classes documented at standards equivalent to other source code?\n\n\nInitiate Tests\nArrange Data\nIf state is required for the test, is it arranged in an organized way? Is state generated using TestFactory_* classes where possible?\n\n\nInitiate Tests\nAct on Data\nDo test methods perform some action on the target system beyond instantiating classes?\n\n\nRun Tests\nAssert Expectations\nDo test methods make meaningful assertions about expected behavior resulting from test actions?\n\n\nRun Tests\nTest All Branches\nDoes the test class make a good effort to test all code branches? Does the test class exercise all public methods in the target class?\n\n\nRun Tests\nTest Valid and Invalid Inputs\nDo test methods make an effort to pass bad or unexpected inputs to the target class? Do test methods exercise exceptions raised by the target class?\n\n\nFormat Tests\nWrite Readable Tests\nDo test methods follow clean code practices? Do test methods display the same use of conventions, factoring and abstractions expected in other source code?\n\n\nFormat Tests\nUse Good Test Names\nAre there multiple tests? Do the names of test methods describe what the test does?\n\n\nFormat Tests\nTest One Concept at a Time\nAre there multiple tests? Does each test have a clear goal?\n\n\n\nHow test classes are evaluated\nAssessment follows these rules:\n\nTests will be read and assessed whenever test code is checked in.\nThe assessor will decide whether your tests achieve a given objective. \nThe assessor will always try to give you credit when your tests make an effort to achieve an objective. \nIn order to be accepted, test classes must meet all of the objectives in Initiate Tests and Run Tests. \nAdditionally, aiming to meet the objectives in Format Tests is highly recommended. Well-formatted tests are much easier to write. Use this to your advantage.\n\nAll assessment is done by the same team member so that the framework can be applied evenly across the team.\nWe encourage two-way communication between yourself and the assessor. The assessor will provide feedback about each test class, which may include fixes to implement before the test class is accepted. On the other hand, you should feel free to contact the assessor at any time to ask questions or discuss concerns.\nDon't be freaked out by the word \"assessed\". The assessor's job is to support you. Feel free to ask questions and talk about difficulties you are encountering. Assessments do not affect your job. We're assessing tests to compare the quality of our test classes, not the quality of our developers.\n"},"overview/example.html":{"url":"overview/example.html","title":"Example: Applying the Framework","keywords":"","body":"Example: Applying the Framework\nThroughout this documentation we will revisit an imaginary class, Model_Coffee, which represents a cup of coffee. Here is an initial implementation of the class:\npublic class Model_Coffee {\n    integer cupCapacity; // in ounces\n    integer liquidAmount; \n\n    public Model_Coffee(integer size) {\n        cupCapacity = size;\n        liquidAmount = size; \n    }\n\n    public void takeASip(integer sipSize) {\n        integer liquidAmountAfterSip = liquidAmount - sipSize;\n        if (liquidAmountAfterSip >= 0) {\n            liquidAmount = liquidAmountAfterSip;\n        } else {\n            liquidAmount = 0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void refillCup() {\n        liquidAmount = cupCapacity;\n    }\n\n    public integer getLiquidAmount() {\n        return liquidAmount;\n    }\n}\n\nAs a first try, here is the test class for Model_Coffee:\n@isTest\npublic class Model_Coffee_Test {\n    static testmethod void testMethod1 {\n        Model_Coffee cup = new Model_Coffee(10);\n        cup.takeASip(2);\n    }\n}\n\nHow does this test class stack up against our framework?\n\n\n\nTheme\nObjective\nPass?\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\nInitiate Tests\nDocument Tests\nNO\nThe test code is simple enough that comments are not required to explain it. However, the developer did not include required header comments.\n\n\nInitiate Tests\nArrange Data\nYES\nData requirements to test Model_Coffee are simple. The developer instantiated everything required for this test in the class constructor.\n\n\nInitiate Tests\nAct on Data\nYES\nA method was called on the Model_Coffee instance.\n\n\nRun Tests\nAssert Expectations\nNO\nThe test method does not expect a particular change to occur as a result of calling takeASip(). The test will pass as long as method invocation does not raise an exception. \n\n\nRun Tests\nTest All Branches\nNO\nThe test class only tests one code path in takeASip(). The other if branch is not tested, and the refillCup() and getLiquidAmount() methods are not tested at all. This test class leaves lots of Model_Coffee untested.\n\n\nRun Tests\nTest Valid and Invalid Inputs\nNO\nWhat happens if the argument to takeASip() is null? What happens if it is negative? What happens if it is 0? All of these scenarios should be tested.\n\n\nFormat Tests\nWrite Readable Tests\nYES\nThe test class is short and easy to follow.\n\n\nFormat Tests\nUse Good Test Names\nNO\nThe test method's name should describe what is being tested. In this case, a name like takeASip_sipLessThanCurrentAmount_returnsExpected would let other developers know what is being tested without having to read the source code. Also, achieving this objective requires that the test class include multiple methods.\n\n\nFormat Tests\nOne Concept at a Time\nNO\nWhile the test class's single method is only performing one operation, achieving this objetive requires that the test class include multiple methods.\n\n\n\nOverall, Model_Coffee_Test scored 3/9 points. \nOf the objectives that must be met for the test class to be accepted (all of the objectives within Initiate Tests and Run Tests), Model_Coffee_Test scored 2/6 points. The test class would be sent back to its developer with feedback about how to improve the tests.\nAs you can see from the explanation of these scores, it would be easy to achieve a passing score of 6/6 for Model_Coffee. A perfect score of 9/9 is also very possible. Each of the objectives is easy on its own, and they get easier as more are achieved in the same class.\nIf you feel confident with the assessment framework, you feel free to jump in and start writing tests at this point. The rest of this guide gives more detail about each objective and additional considerations.\n"},"objectives/1-document.html":{"url":"objectives/1-document.html","title":"1. Document Your Tests","keywords":"","body":"Document Your Tests\n\nAre tests methods and classes documented at standards equivalent to other source code?\n\nYour code is meant to be read. It should display good use of method/variable names and clear logic that makes your intention clear. This isn't always possible, however--and when things get tricky, you are required to comment your code. \nTo receive credit for this objective:\n\nCode should be clearly understood by a reader who has never seen your test class (or the class being tested) before. If this is not possible--see objective 7--then you are required to explain your code using comments. If your code doesn't require comments to explain what's happening, awesome work!

Arrange Data","keywords":"","body":"Arrange Data\n\nIf state is required for the test, is it assembled in an organized way? Is state generated using TestFactory_* classes where possible?\n\nThe first step in testing any object-oriented code is assembling state required for the test. Sometimes this is simple, as in (the framework overview example)[../overview/example.md]. Sometimes it is much more complicated, requiring multiple levels of objects to be generated.\nThe framework requires that state assembly is logical and organized. In addition, where possible, assembly should be factored away using the TestFactory_* family of classes. These utility classes greatly simplify the generation of complex object heirarchies, and are more likely to be bug-free than code written specifically for your test class.\n\"Arrange Data\" is the first part of the Arrange/Act/Assert pattern. Use of this pattern is highly recommended for test classes.\nTo receive credit for this objective:\n\nRequired state should be arranged at the beginning of your test method, before you begin acting on target object(s). There should be a clear separation between creating the test environment and acting on the test environment. \nState should be generated using the TestFactory_* classes whenever possible. This rule may not apply if an appropriate method(s) do not exist on those classes (e.g. no methods to generate a certain object, no methods to generate a certain object for bulk operations).\n\n"},"objectives/3-act.html":{"url":"objectives/3-act.html","title":"3. Act on Data","keywords":"","body":"Act on Data\n\nDo test methods perform some action on the target system beyond instantiating classes?\n\nMany tests in our current test code simply instantiate the class being tested, relying on constructor code (and private methods called within) to reach >75% code coverage.\nThe framework requires that tests perform specific actions on the target class. For the most part, this means calling public methods. Preferably each test will only call one method and then check its result.\n\"Act on Data\" is the second part of the Arrange/Act/Assert pattern. Use of this pattern is highly recommended for test classes.\nThis objective sits between arrange and assert. Together, all three objectives should tell a coherent 'story' about what you are trying to test and what you expect to happen as a result. Most of the time, the act part of this story should be a single method call.\nTo receive credit for this objective:\n\nTest methods should perform specific actions on the target class.\nActions performed on the target class should be easily identifiable and should be performed after arranging state.\n\n"},"objectives/4-assert.html":{"url":"objectives/4-assert.html","title":"4. Assert Expectations","keywords":"","body":"Assert Expectations\n\nDo test methods make meaningful assertions about expected behavior resulting from test actions?\n\nMany tests in our current test code arrange state and act on target classes, but don't confirm that the expected behavior of the target class has actually occurred.\nAssertions are the heart of unit testing. They allow us to prove that our code performs the way we expect. They also allow us to document the contract of our code, by demonstrating how the target class will react to different inputs.\n\"Assert Expectations\" is the final part of the Arrange/Act/Assert pattern. Use of this pattern is highly recommended for test classes.\nAll test methods must assert some behavior. Assertions must be meaningful. A meaningful assertion shows something specific about your code. It must be clear that your assertion is relevant to the action you have performed in the test method.\nWe recommend that each test method contain a single assertion. This encourages developers to exercise one concept per test. However, test methods can contain more than one assertion as long as both assertions are still testing one concept. For example, you may wish to use two assertions to prove that a single method call mutates two fields on the object being tested.\nSome developers like to extend the Arrange/Act/Assert pattern to Arrange/Assert/Act/Assert, to confirm that state has been instantiated correctly or to highlight some important part of state arrangement for a future reader. If you're comfortable with this style, go ahead and use it. Just don't go overboard!\nExamples\nUseless assertions\n@isTest\npublic class Model_CoffeeMaker_Test {\n    static testmethod void testMethod() {\n        Model_CoffeeMaker maker = new Model_CoffeeMaker(20) // 20 ounce capacity\n        System.assert( maker.pourCoffee() <> null );\n    }\n}\n\nAssuming the test in Model_CoffeeMaker_Test passes, the only things we know about Model_CoffeeMaker.pourCoffee() is that it:\n\nDoes not raise an exception, and\nDoes not return null.\n\nAlmost anything else could be happen when .pourCoffee() is called. The assertion here is not specific enough; It should tell us something precise about the result of the method call.\nMeaningful assertions\nHere are two simple ways to ensure your assertions are meaningful:\n\nTry to assert what the return valus is (e.g. System.assert(x == 3)) rather than what it is not (e.g. System.assert(x != null)).\nThe assertion should be specific enough to fail if the target class's public interface changes.\n\nIt's easy to write meaningful assertions with these guidelines in mind. Let's write a new method for the test class above.\n@isTest\npublic class Model_CoffeeMaker_Test {\n    // ... other test methods snipped\n\n    static testmethod void pourCoffee_20oz_transfers8ozToNewCup() {\n        // Arrange\n        Model_CoffeeMaker maker = new Model_CoffeeMaker(20) // 20 ounce capacity\n\n        // Act\n        Model_Coffee cup = maker.pourCoffee();\n\n        // Assert\n        System.assert( cup.getLiquidAmount() == 8 );\n        System.assert( maker.getLiquidAmount() == 12 );\n    }\n}\n\nThis test is clear about what pourCoffee() does. We can even read the test as a kind of documentation or example of how the method works. Imagine the same test, but with the Assert clauses replaced with != null. Much less clear, right?\nNote that this method only tests one aspect of pourCoffee()'s behavior. For example, what would have happened if Model_CoffeeMaker were instantiated with fewer than 8 ounces of liquid? This test doesn't know or care--checking that behavior is the responsibility of another test.\nTo receive credit for this objective:\n\nTest methods must make meaningful assertions about the result of test actions.\n\n"},"objectives/5-branches.html":{"url":"objectives/5-branches.html","title":"5. Test All Branches","keywords":"","body":"Test All Branches\n\nDoes the test class make a good effort to test all code branches? Does the test class exercise all public methods in the target class?\n\nTest methods should test all logic branches in the target class. This rule is critical in cases where different logic branches can execute vastly different computations.\nTest classes should test all public methods in the target class. It doesn't matter if your test class has already reached 75% code coverage; all public methods must be tested.\nWe are only concerned with testing the public interfaces of target classes. This means that private methods don't need to be tested specifically (by elevating the access level to public). \nIf you notice that a private method returns tricky results, feel free to target that method with some tests exercising its associated public method. However, beware of overtesting private methods. Private interfaces can change without notice, so don't assemble state specifically to trip up private methods. Think about testing from the perspective of the public interface.\nTo receive credit for this objective:\n\nTest methods should test all logic branches.\nTest classes should fully test all public methods in the target class.\n\n"},"objectives/6-valid-invalid.html":{"url":"objectives/6-valid-invalid.html","title":"6. Test Valid and Invalid Inputs","keywords":"","body":"Test Valid and Invalid Inputs\n\nDo test methods make an effort to pass bad or unexpected inputs to the target class? Do test methods exercise exceptions raised by the target class?\n\nAll public methods in the target class should be tested with a set of both valid and invalid inputs. You may have to use your imagination. To start with, the following inputs should be tried:\n\nAn expected value\nA null value\nFor string inputs, an unexpected (if the method expects a magic string) or long value\nFor collection types, an empty collection\nFor collection types, a small (\nFor collection types, a large (> 200 entries) collection \nFor reference types, an object with null fields that the target method will access\n\nFor methods which don't take inputs, examine the target method's source code and imagine situations where the method makes assumptions about its environment that might not be true:\n\nDoes the method expect certain information to exist in the database?\nDoes the method expect another field to be instantiated on itself before it is called?\nDoes the method make a network call that might fail?\n\nTry your best to create circumstances that will raise exceptions. Knowing what kinds of inputs the target class will accept is a vital part of keeping our code base robust. It is also useful when using tests as documentation.\nIf you encounter an unexpected return value (such as null or an exception) as a result of any of these inputs, your next move depends on the state of the target method.\n\nIf you are currently designing the target method, consider whether this unexpected value is what should be returned from the given input. If not, change the method accordingly.\nIf you are writing the test class at a later time, perhaps long after another developer has written the target method, consider the result to be intended behavior unless it truly looks like a bug.\n\nHow to test exceptions:\nHere is a simple construct for testing exceptions:\npublic class Model_CoffeeMaker_Test {\n    // ... other test methods snipped\n\n    static testmethod void pourCoffee_4oz_raisesNotEnoughLiquidException() {\n        // Arrange\n        Model_CoffeeMaker maker = new Model_CoffeeMaker(4) // 4 ounce capacity\n\n        // Act\n        try {\n            // pourCoffee() removes 8 ounces from maker.\n            Model_Coffee cup = maker.pourCoffee();\n            System.assert ( false );\n        } catch (NotEnoughLiquidException e) {\n            // Assert\n            System.assert( true );\n        }\n    }\n\nIf pourCoffee() doesn't raise an exception, execution will move to System.assert(false) and fail the test. \nIf pourCoffee() raises an exception, execution moves to the catch block. A NotEnoughLiquidException is caught and executes System.assert(true), causing the test to pass. Any other exception will escape the catch and cause the test to fail.\nThis pattern makes your intent explicit. You intend to raise a specific exception with the call to pourCoffee(), and the test won't pass under any other circumstances.\nTo receive credit for this objective:\n\nThe target method should be exercised with an exhaustive range of valid and invalid inputs. Where appropriate, the target method's environment should be adjusted to demonstrate its behavior in unexpected conditions.\nThe test class should raise exceptions in the target class whenever possible.\n\n"},"objectives/7-readable.html":{"url":"objectives/7-readable.html","title":"7.

Variable names should be descriptive.
